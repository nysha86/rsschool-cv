            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Continuous self-education is the basis of success (I think so)))). I try to learn something new every 
                day.This knowledge opens up new opportunities for me in life.I am very very friendly :))) I can listen
                 and hear the enemy in controversial situations and alwaystry to find a compromise. I like to work 
                 independently and as a team. I really want to try to become a front-end developer, because it seems 
                 to me that what I need)) At the moment, my front-end skills are limited by the course program and 
                 additional materials, but I have a great desire to learn.</p>
